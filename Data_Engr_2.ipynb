        "\n",
        "POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is an IEEE 1003.1 standard that defines the language interface between application programs (along with command line shells and utility interfaces) and the UNIX operating systems. It was created to standardize the functionality and behaviour of Unix-like operating systems. It specifies APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for various components, including file I/O, process management, inter-process communication, and more. POSIX compliance ensures that software written to the POSIX standards can be executed across different Unix-like systems without major modifications or compatibility issues.\n",

        "### UNIX\n",
        "\n",
        "UNIX is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s. An operating system can be thought of as a collection of programs that make the computer work. It is a *stable*, *multi-user*, *multi-tasking* system for servers, desktops and laptops. UNIX systems also have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no GUI available, for example, a telnet session.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Types\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many different versions of UNIX, although they share common similarities. The most popular varieties of UNIX are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Linux\n",
        "\n",
        "Linux, on the other hand, is a free and open-source operating system kernel that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux was developed as a Unix-like system, inspired by Minix and older Unix branches. Unlike Unix, Linux is not a single operating system but rather a kernel that can be combined with various software packages to create complete operating systems called distributions. These distributions, such as Ubuntu, include the Linux kernel and additional software to provide a complete computing environment. It is under GPL license.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The UNIX / Linux operating system is made up of three parts; the **kernel**, the **shell** and the **Application**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Kernel** is the hub of the operating system which allocates resources to programs and handles the file storage and communications in response to system calls.\n",
        "* **Shell** acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program verifies the username and password, and starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt.\n",
        "* **Application** layer runs many user and background processes. A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier).\n",

        "### Ubuntu\n",
        "\n",
        "Ubuntu is a Linux-based operating system distribution. It was created by Canonical Ltd. and released in 2004 with the goal of making Linux more accessible to a wider range of users. Ubuntu builds upon user-friendly interfaces, and software ecosystem. It aims to provide a complete and polished user experience, focusing on ease of use, regular releases, and a large community of users and developers. Ubuntu also uses the APT package management system and offers a wide variety of software applications through its repositories. It is known for its strong focus on desktop usability but also has versions tailored for servers, cloud environments, and other specialized use cases."
